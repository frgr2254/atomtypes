# Example input file for atomtype.py

#Short description of input file options and syntax:

#Keyword COORDINATES specifies the path to the trajectory file containing particle coordinate

COORDINATES /home/fredrik/Documents/phd_article2/systems/atio2_cutradius8_5A_boxlen25A/snapshots/13525/snapshot3.xyz

#Keyword CHARGEMOL is followed by a path that points to the directory where chargemol outputfiles are located

CHARGEMOL /home/fredrik/Documents/phd_article2/systems/atio2_cutradius8_5A_boxlen25A/snapshots/23525

FREE_ATOM_DATA /home/fredrik/Documents/phd_article2/systems/atio2_cutradius8_5A_boxlen25A/snapshots/23525

#Keyword PERIODIC is specified followed by three numbers in the same line, being the x-, y- and z-dimnesions of the orthorhombic simulation box, #the code computes distances between atoms using periodic boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions are only implemented for orthorhombic #cells.

PERIODIC 24.5 24.5 24.5

#The ATOMTYPE keyword starts a 'definition line', i.e. a line defining an atom type. In each definition line the ATOMTYPE keyword is followed by #an element symbol (for example O, H or Ti) that defines the element of atom type. The element symbol is followed by the name of the atom type #(e.g. TiA). These three items (ATOMTYPE-keyword, element symbol, atom type name) completes a definition line.
#The definition line is followed by an arbitrary number of 'condition lines'. Each condition lines specifices a distance condition that must be #satistfied by an atom belonging to this atom type. The syntax to specify distance conditions is the following: first the name of the atom type #to which the condition apllies. Second an integer specifying the number of neighbours. Third is the element symbol telling what is the element #of the neighbours. Last is decimal number specifying the maximum distance within which these neigbours should be found.

ATOMTYPE Ti TiA #Defines a titanium atom type TiA defined by two conditions
CONDITION TiA 6 O 3.0 #Distance condition I: TiA type has 6 oxygen atoms within 3.0 angstrom


ATOMTYPE Ti TiB 
CONDITION TiB 5 O 3.0 
 

ATOMTYPE Ti TiC 
CONDITION TiC 4 O 3.0 
 

ATOMTYPE Ti TiD 
CONDITION TiD 3 O 3.0 


ATOMTYPE O OA 
CONDITION OA 3 Ti 3.0 


ATOMTYPE O OB 
CONDITION OB 2 Ti 3.0 


ATOMTYPE O Ow 
CONDITION Ow 2 H 1.5


ATOMTYPE H Hw
CONDITION Hw 1 O 1.5


ATOMTYPE H HB
CONDITION HB 2 O 1.5



#If keyword ITP is found in the same line in the input file this signals that the code should generate a gromacs .itp file. ITP keyword is #followed by the name of the molecule written in the itp file. This requires the user to define maximum bond lengths (distance within which atom #A of type X and atom B of type Y are considered to be bonded). Such definitions are made using the BOND keyword followed by the names of the #atom types and the maximum bond distance. 

ITP TiO2

#Keyword BOND followed by names of two atom types (A and B) and a max bond length (d) specifies that atoms belonging to types A and B
#should be considered as bonded if they ar within distance d Angstrom.

#BOND TiA OA 3.0 #atom of type TiA is bonded to atom of type OA if the distance between them is less than 3.0 angstrom

#BOND TiA OB 3.0



#If keyword PDB and TRUE are found in the same line the code writes atom types and particle coordinates to a .pdb file.
#PDB TRUE
