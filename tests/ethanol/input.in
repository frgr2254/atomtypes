# Example input file for atomtype.py

#Short description of input file options and syntax:

#Keyword COORDINATES specifies the path to the trajectory file containing particle coordinate

COORDINATES ./ethanol.xyz

#Keyword CHARGEMOL is followed by a path that points to the directory where chargemol outputfiles are located

#Keyword PERIODIC is specified followed by three numbers in the same line, being the x-, y- and z-dimnesions of the orthorhombic simulation box, #the code computes distances between atoms using periodic boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions are only implemented for orthorhombic #cells.

PERIODIC 24.5 24.5 24.5

#The ATOMTYPE keyword starts a 'definition line', i.e. a line defining an atom type. In each definition line the ATOMTYPE keyword is followed by #an element symbol (for example O, H or Ti) that defines the element of atom type. The element symbol is followed by the name of the atom type #(e.g. TiA). These three items (ATOMTYPE-keyword, element symbol, atom type name) completes a definition line.
#The definition line is followed by an arbitrary number of 'condition lines'. Each condition lines specifices a distance condition that must be #satistfied by an atom belonging to this atom type. The syntax to specify distance conditions is the following: first the name of the atom type #to which the condition apllies. Second an integer specifying the number of neighbours. Third is the element symbol telling what is the element #of the neighbours. Last is decimal number specifying the maximum distance within which these neigbours should be found.

ATOMTYPE C CA #Defines a titanium atom type CA defined by two conditions
CONDITION CA 0 O 1.6 #Distance condition: CA type has 0 oxygen atoms within 1.6 angstrom

ATOMTYPE C CB 
CONDITION CB 1 O 1.6

ATOMTYPE O OA 
CONDITION OA 1 C 1.6

ATOMTYPE H HA 
CONDITION HA 0 O 1.1

ATOMTYPE H HB 
CONDITION HB 1 O 1.1

#If keyword ITP is found in the same line in the input file this signals that the code should generate a gromacs .itp file. ITP keyword is #followed by the name of the molecule written in the itp file. This requires the user to define maximum bond lengths (distance within which atom #A of type X and atom B of type Y are considered to be bonded). Such definitions are made using the BOND keyword followed by the names of the #atom types and the maximum bond distance. 

ITP ethanol

#Keyword BOND followed by names of two atom types (A and B) and a max bond length (d) specifies that atoms belonging to types A and B
#should be considered as bonded if they ar within distance d Angstrom.

BOND CB OA 1.6 #atom of type CA is bonded to atom of type OA if the distance between them is less than 1.6 angstrom

BOND CA CB 1.6

BOND CA HA 1.3

BOND CB HA 1.3

BOND OA HB 1.3







#If keyword PDB and TRUE are found in the same line the code writes atom types and particle coordinates to a .pdb file.
PDB TRUE
