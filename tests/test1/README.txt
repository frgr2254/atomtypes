Test of atomtypes code for a small test structure (see test1.xyz).

Periodic boundary conditions are not used.

Atom types (1-coordinated Ti, 2-coordinated Ti, 1-coordinated O and 2 coordinated O) are defined in input.in
  
A print statement is added in the 'compute_distance()' function to show the interatomic distances calculated by the code which is then
compared with the distance obtained in a molecular editor.
