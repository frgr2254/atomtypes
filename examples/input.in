# Example input file for atomtype.py
#
#Short description of input file options and syntax:

#Keyword COORDINATES specifies the path to the trajectory file containing particle coordinate

COORDINATES /home/fredrik/Documents/phd_article2/atomtypes/examples/snapshot8.xyz

#Keyword PERIODIC is specified followed by three numbers in the same line, being the x-, y- and z-dimnesions of the orthorhombic simulation box, the #code computes distances between atoms using periodic boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions are only implemented for orthorhombic cells.

PERIODIC 24.5 24.5 24.5

#The ATOMTYPE keyword starts a 'definition line', i.e. a line defining an atom type. In each definition line the ATOMTYPE keyword is followed by #an element symbol (for example O, H or Ti) that defines the element of atom type. The element symbol is followed by the name of the atom type #(e.g. TiA). These three items (ATOMTYPE-keyword, element symbol, atom type name) completes a definition line.
#The definition line is followed by an arbitrary number of 'condition lines'. Each condition lines specifices a distance condition that must be #satistfied by an atom belonging to this atom type. The syntax to specify distance conditions is the following: first the name of the atom type to which the condition apllies. Second an integer specifying the number of neighbours. Third is the element symbol telling what is the element of the neighbours. Last is decimal number specifying the maximum distance within which these neigbours should be found.
